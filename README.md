This my version of Odin Project's calculator exercise, note it carries out operations in mathematically-correct order (ie BEDMAS)

I was fortunate to have the time to make this project a learning experience, and I wanted the ability to execute multiple operations in the correct order. My strategy was to store each number and operand in an array, and then search the array using "if" statements to execute multiplication / division first. At each step the array is updated, replacing the 2 numbers and the operand with the resulting value. At the end, the array contains a single number, the final answer. Error messages were coded for multiple decimal points, etc. If you find any bugs, please let me know!

I added on some extra features such as being able to drag and drop the calculator on the screen if viewed on desktop mode as a learning experience. I would like to improve the responsive design of the project, with a more attractive mobile version calculator.
